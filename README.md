## 🔍 Key Objectives
- Analyze customer and loan data to detect default patterns.  
- Engineer features such as **loan-to-income ratio** and **credit utilization bands** for better segmentation.  
- Visualize data to identify high-risk loan applicants.  
- Recommend strategies to reduce loan default probability.

## 🛠️ Features & Analysis
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handled missing values, outliers, and encoded categorical features.  
- **Feature Engineering:** Created derived features like **loan-to-income ratio** to enhance insights.  
- **Data Visualization:** Generated histograms, correlation heatmaps, stacked bar charts, and distribution plots.  
- **Insights:** Found that applicants with **poor credit history and high loan-to-income ratio** have the highest default probability, suggesting stricter credit assessment policies.
